# Raytracer CPP

This repo is an implementation of the [Ray Tracer Challenge from
Jamis Buck](https://pragprog.com/titles/jbtracer/). In this book
the author provides the test cases in a feature/scenario description
in a language agnostic format and leaves it to the reader to provide
the implementation.
